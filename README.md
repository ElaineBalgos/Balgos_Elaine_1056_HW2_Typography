### Nestled in the heart of Muskoka, Muskoka Brewery handcrafts premium beers as unique and refreshing as the region theyâ€™re from. Founders Gary McMullen and Kirk Evans kicked open the doors of Muskoka Brewery in June of 1996. Currently owned and operated by Todd Lewin and Bob MacDonald, what started as a very small and dedicated team has quickly grown to a passionate band of beer lovers more than 130 strong. In short, we have a passion for great beer and we hope you get a chance to enjoy it
